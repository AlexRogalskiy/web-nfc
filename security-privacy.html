    This document provides a collection of security and privacy related topics
    concerning web pages and applications using Near Field Communication (NFC).
    More information about Web NFC can be found in the
    <a href="http://w3c.github.io/web-nfc/index.html#abstract">Web NFC API</a>
    specification.

    This document provides background for security and privacy related decisions
    for the <a href="http://w3c.github.io/web-nfc/index.html">Web NFC API</a>.
    Comments on the document should be filed as issues at

</section>

<section> <h2>Terminology</h2>
  <p>
    For NFC terminology, please consult the
    <a href="http://w3c.github.io/web-nfc/index.html#terminology">
    Web NFC specification</a>.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="informative"> <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    NFC technology involves multiple levels of security. Payments done with NFC
    are considered to be at least as secure as with payment cards at hardware
    level, but the whole software stack needs to be security hardened.
    However, data transfer (reads, writes and push) involve more threats. This
    document discusses some of the relevant threats and possible remedies, as
    input to API design and implementation decisions.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="informative"> <h2>Trust model</h2>
  <p>
    Web pages using the NFC API are not trusted.
    This means that the user needs to be aware of exactly what a web page is
    intending to do with NFC at any given moment. Also, implementations SHOULD
    make sure that when the user authorizes an NFC operation, then only that
    action is run, without side effects, and exactly in the context and the
    number of times the user allows the execution of NFC operations.
  </p>
  <p>
    Web apps installed from a store, or web pages installed to home screen (with
    [[MANIFEST]]) MAY be considered trusted by the user agent.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="informative"> <h2>Attacker model</h2>
  <p>
    The following patterns have been considered:
    <ul>
      <li>malicious web page and benign user: phishing user data</li>
      <li>malicious web page prepared by malicious user: destroying tags</li>
      <li>malicious or modified tags prepared for attacking devices.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
</section>

<section class="informative"> <h2>Threats and possible solutions</h2>
  <p>
    <table class="simple" border="1">
      <tr>
        <th><strong>Threat</strong></th>
        <th><strong>Comments</strong></th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Web page using the Web NFC API collects user data without the
          consent of the user</td>
        <td>use permissions and user prompts for accessing personal data,
          minimize user data exposed to NFC</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Malicious web page overwrites tags without user consent</td>
        <td>Permission and user prompt needed for writing tags</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>malicious web page writes sensitive user data to tags and peer
          devices</td>
        <td>permission/user prompt for writing tags and peers, with a
          possibility the user can check what data is sent, or fine grained
          permissions on what kind of data could be sent</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>malicious tag may be involuntarily or voluntarily read by devices
          and the data read may constitute an attack vector on the user agent
        </td>
        <td>This is a generic problem with all existing NFC tags;
           implementations need security hardening; involuntary touch is low probability due to short range and critical angle for reading;
           it’s easier to attack elsewhere (e.g. WiFi and Bluetooth)
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>malicious smart poster tag attempts triggering an action on the
          device which may be a threat</td>
        <td>support for smart posters is not among the main use cases of Web
          NFC; if and when supported, no automatic actions should be allowed,
          the user must be made aware and given the ability to control what is
          happening during the NFC communication</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </p>
</section>

<section class="informative"> <h2>Security policies</h2>
  <p>
    In order to minimize attack surface using the Web NFC API, user agents MAY
    implement multiple security policies, for example some of the following:
    <ul>
      <li>reading is not allowed from generic NFC tags but only from special
        Web NFC tags</li>
      <li>reading is allowed from generic tags, if the reading page scheme is
        e.g. https</li>
      <li>writing (updates) allowed only to existing special Web NFC tags where
        the writing page origin fulfills certain conditions.</li>
    </ul>
    The Web NFC API specification may require the existence of some of the
    policies above, and may make others optional. However, all the mechanisms
    needed to implement these security policies should be supported by the
    implementations.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="informative"> <h2>Security mechanisms</h2>
  <p>
    In order to support security policies concerning the Web NFC API, certain
    mechanisms need to be supported in all the implementations, such as:
    <ul>
      <li>an identification mechanism for telling apart “Web NFC tags” from
        generic NFC tags</li>
      <li>a mechanism for whitelisting URL's that can read, or write a certain
        Web NFC tag</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
</section>

<section class="informative"> <h2>Implementation details</h2>
  <p>
    This section contains discussion of implementation possibilities of security
    related mechanisms. The following implementation alternatives are possible:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Use additional NDEF records in an NDEF message, containing
        metadata specific to Web NFC specific, such as identification, and
        whitelists for reading and writing.
      </li>
        Use a specific Web NFC record format and encode the metadata specific to
        Web NFC into that.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <section> <h3>Whitelists and the <strong>NfcAccess</strong> dictionary</h3>
    <p>
      A <dfn>whitelist</dfn> is an array of <code>NfcAccess</code>
      dictionaries.
    </p>
    <dl title="dictionary NfcAccess" class="idl">
      <dt>DOMString scope</dt>
      <dt>boolean canWrite</dt>
    </dl>
    <p>
      The <dfn id="widl-NfcAccess-scope">scope</dfn> property is a string
      pattern for matching the URL's that are explicitly allowed to access
      the data, for instance <br>
      <code>{ "scope": "https://mydomain.com", "canWrite": "true"}</code>. <br>
      Scopes which don't
      <a href="http://w3c.github.io/web-nfc/#the-within-scope-algorithm">match</a> this are not permitted to access the data.
      If the whitelist is empty, then the platform default policy applies,
      which SHOULD permit reading for everyone, but SHOULD prevent writing,
      except to URL's which
      <a href="http://w3c.github.io/web-nfc/#the-within-scope-algorithm">match</a> the origin of the page which wrote the existing data.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the <dfn id="widl-NfcAccess-canWrite">canWrite</dfn> property is
      <code>true</code>, then the URL's matching <code><var>scope</var></code>
      are permitted to write (in fact, update) the data, otherwise they are only permitted to read it.
    </p>
    <p class="issue">
      The exact meaning of scope, pattern, and the matching algorithm to origins
      need to be reviewed with the
      <a href="http://www.w3.org/2011/webappsec/">Web Application Security WG</a>.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section> <h3>Additional NDEF records for Web NFC</h3>
    <p>
      A typical Web NFC NDEF message will contain the following
      NDEF records:
      <ul>
        <li>Normal NDEF records carrying data.</li>
        <li>
          Optionally, an NDEF record for Web NFC identification.
          The preferred type of this NDEF record is NFC Forum External Type
          (TNF=0x04), with the External Type field set to
          <code>urn:nfc:ext:w3.org:webnfc-id</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Optionally, a NDEF record representing a <a>whitelist</a>.
          The preferred type of this NDEF record is NFC Forum External Type
          (TNF=0x04), with the External Type field set to
          <code>urn:nfc:ext:w3.org:webnfc-wl</code>.
          The payload is an array of <code><a>NfcAccess</a></code> dictionaries.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
  </section>
  <section> <h3>Web NFC using encoded metadata</h3>
    <p>
      As an alternative to the previous section, Web NFC may also define a
      record format based on NFC Forum External Type (TNF=0x04) records, where
      the External Type field set to <code>urn:nfc:ext:w3.org:webnfc</code>.
      The payload type is <code>application/webnfc+json</code> (encoded as
      UTF-8 by default). All data is JSON, with the following schema:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <code>id</code>: <code>"string"</code>; contains the Web NFC
          identifier, e.g. the SHA256 signature of
          <code>"w3.org/web-nfc”</code>. This is not strictly needed.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>origin</code>: <code>"string"</code>; contains the
          <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/browsers.html#ascii-serialisation-of-an-origin">ASCII serialized origin</a> which
          has written the data. Also, this is not strictly needed, since it can
          be also stored at the NDEF record's <code>id</code> field.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>messageType</code>: <code>"string"</code>; contains the type of
          the data, either <code>"text"</code>, <code>"url"</code>,
          <code>"json"</code>, or <code>"blob"</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>message</code>: <code>"string"</code>; contains the payload data
          encoded as text (text, URL and JSON), and for blob encoded as
          Base64 ([[RFC4648]]).
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>access</code>: <code>"array"</code>; contains the
          <a>whitelist</a> for defining access control to the data.
        </li>
      </ul>

    <p class="note">
      The encoded JSON format for Web NFC data and metadata is useful for
      abstracting away NFC Forum types, and for supporting implementations where
      an NDEF message contains only one NDEF record.
